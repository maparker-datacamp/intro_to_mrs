author_bio: Revolution Analytics was founded in 2007 to foster the R Community, as well as 
  support the growing needs of commercial users. Our name derives from combining the letter "R" 
  with the word "evolution." It speaks to the ongoing development of the R language from an 
  open-source academic research tool into commercial applications for industrial use.
